# Predicting Diabetes with AI KNN Algorithm

In this project, using the KNN Algorithm, the accuracy of the prediction of diabetes and whether a new patient is sick when a new patient is added were investigated.

#### Example of data used:

#### For example:

When k is selected as 3 and test size is selected as 0.1, the accuracy rate of disease prediction after applying the algorithm is 0.83.

#### Finding the best k value:

Additionally, if you want to find the best k value for your algorithm, you will get a result like this.
It was seen that the k value that gave the highest accuracy rate for this example was 3 or 6.

#### When additional data is added to a new patient:

You can find out whether the patient is sick or healthy.
In this example, a healthy estimate has been made for the person.
